to send an alarm to a local ESP32 server and then to send the image to Gmail.

Capturing an image takes significant time (1/2 to 1 second) if you initialise the camera and change some of itâ€™s settings, after starting a trigger.
It was found that doing camera.init() and changing any camera settings that you could go to lightsleep(), waiting for a trigger, and when woken-up the picture would be taken within 10-100ms.  
On the ESP32-CAM board the standby current was about 150mA, with the camera initialised.  Initialising the camera, going to lightsleep() and removing the 3V3 regulator got that current down to around 15mA.
A single 18650 Li-ion cell and a 1 or 2W 6V PV panel is probably adequate for remote use.
I found that trying to increase framesize and/or improve the quality could result in poor images, some of the time.

N.B.  do a config.poweron_reset.on() instead of a machine.reset() or the camera will not be properly initialised.

Have also included a schematic for a IR receiver and the poweron_reset circuits.
