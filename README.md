to send an alarm to a local ESP32 server and then to send the image to Gmail.

Capturing an image takes significant time (1/2 to 1 second) if you initialise the camera and change some of itâ€™s settings, after starting a trigger.
It was found that doing camera.init() and changing any camera settings that you could go to lightsleep(), waiting for a trigger, and when woken-up the picture would be taken within 10-100ms.  
On the ESP32-CAM board the standby current was about 150mA, with the camera initialised.  Initialising the camera, going to lightsleep() and removing the 3V3 regulator got that current down to around 25mA.
Two 18650 Li-ion cells and a 5W 6V PV panel is probably adequate for remote use.
I found that trying to increase framesize and/or improve the quality could result in poor images, some of the time.

You need to do a machine.reset() at the start or the camera will not be properly initialised.

Sometimes the ESP32-CAM does not seem to initialise properly with machine.reset(). Have added an updated schematic for a IR receiver and a poweron_reset circuit.

With lightsleep and taking subsequent pictures, I still get the odd over-exposed picture.
